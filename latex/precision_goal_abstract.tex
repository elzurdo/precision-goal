Sequential hypothesis testing is a process in which a practitioner does not predefine a
sample size but relies on assumptions about incoming data to indicate that enough has
been collected to make a decision about a hypothesis. Most commonly used approaches
apply an accept/reject decision criterion as a stopping criterion which makes results
prone to biases, such as confirmation bias due to the possibility of obtaining extreme
results. Although known as a problem with the frequentist {\it p-value} mechanism, it is not
magically resolved with Bayesian approaches. To resolve this issue, a predetermined
accuracy in parameter estimation has been advocated as a stopping criterion.
In particular Kruschke (2015) \cite{kruschke2015doing} showed that defining in advance an objective precision as
a stopping criterion, a method called {\it Precision is the Goal}, eliminates bias in the
case of dichotomous outcomes sampling. Whereas we find this to be true, we highlight
important practical details, in particular when the posterior doesn’t clearly indicate
if the null hypothesis may neither be rejected or accepted, i.e, a situation of
“inconclusiveness”. In cases where the null hypothesis is true, when applying
“Precision is the Goal” we find that even though the null hypothesis is never
incorrectly rejected (free from False positives), the majority of the decisions may
be inconclusive. 
To address this problem we introduce a conservative variant of this method which we call
{\it Enhanced Precision Is The Goal} in which the stopping criterion simultaneously
requires fulfilling the precision objective as well as the
reject/accept decision criterions. We apply to synthetic  data and show that it may
substantially reduce inconclusiveness at the cost of larger sample sizes. In one
reasonable setting we find this to reduce from 61\% inconclusiveness to sub 2\%
requiring a sample size on average 22\% larger. 
We also provide an online calculator with source code which aims to make usage of
“Precision is the Goal'' more commonplace in planning of data collection as well as
experiment interpretation.
