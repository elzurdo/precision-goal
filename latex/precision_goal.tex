\section{Paper Structure}
The paper is organized as follows. In the Methods section, we describe three stop criteria as well as the setup to test on synthetic dichotomous data. In the Results section, we present the results of the synthetic data analysis as well as analytical analysis. In the Discussion section, we discuss the implications of the results. In the Conclusion section, we summarize the findings and suggest future directions.

\section{Discussion}

Aspects not addressed in the paper:

\begin{itemize}
  \item adding a prior (quite trivial for this setup -- just updating success and failure counts)
  \item continuous data
  \item non analytiucal solutions - would require sampling methods like MCMC which would take much longer to calculate (may be less of an issue with future computer power, e.g, quantum computers)
\end{itemize}

\section{Submission Instructions}

Methods Paper—maximum word count: 6500
Methods Papers present an advance likely to make major impact in one or more applied
fields. While theory (e.g. theorems concerning statistical or
learning-theoretic properties) are welcome, this is not essential, but intuition and
understanding of why the method works is important.
We are also very open to theory in a broader sense including examples and conjectures.
Generally, we would expect empirical results to demonstrate effectiveness.
However, in cases where the extent of methodological/conceptual innovation is large
enough, results themselves may be illustrative and need not be of immediate high impact
in any particular applied domain.

Each piece should include:

Unstructured Abstract—maximum word count: 250

Each submission must contain the following sections and use these terms as the first
level section headers: Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion and Conclusion
(Discussion and Conclusion may be combined).

{\bf Talking Points to Include}

* Frequentist methods cannot accept null hypothesis:  In the Frequentist case practitioners set the stop criterion that triggers according to a sample to hypothesis p-value and then decide if to reject the null hypothesis (Frequentist methods cannot accept null hypotheses because p-values do not contain enough information).
