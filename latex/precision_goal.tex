\subsection{Contributions}

\subsubsection{Paper Structure}
The paper is organized as follows.
In the Methods section we describe three (four if Frequentist?)
stop criteria as well as the setup to test on synthetic deichotomous data.
In the Results section we present the results of the synthetic data analysis as well as analytical analysis.
In the Discussion section we discuss the implications of the results (Reword this).
In the Conclusion section we summarize the findings and suggest future directions (Reword this).


\section{Methods}

Here we describe three stop criteria for sequential hypothesis testing,
all of which rely on the same decision criterion to determine acceptence
or rejection of the null hypothesis.

We describe and contrast the algorithms intuitively, as well as in pseudo code.
We provide also anlaytical useful experessions and conclude by describing a setup
to test the methods on synthetic dichotomous data.
Although our belief is that these methods apply to any type of data,
our focus is on Bernouli trials in order to compare with \cite{kruschke2015doing}
(somehow experess that: "as it is simple to describe analytically and
to conduct rapid tests on synthetic data.")

\subsection{One Decision Criterion And Three Stop Criteria}

Table (cite table) provides an intuitive comparison between the three algorithms of interst.
In order to conduct this comparison we consider:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Pre Survey Decisions - the parameters required to decide ahead of data
    collection
    \item The stop criterion main characteristic 
    \item The decision criterion characteristic
    \item Stop and Decision order - are they simultaneous a two step process?
\end{itemize}
By creterion {\it characteristic} we are referring to the property of the posterior of
importance: its location and/or width

        \item $N_\mathrm{min}$ - the minimal sample size to collect (needs further explanation)
        \item $N_\mathrm{max}$ - the maximum sample size
        \item $\sigma_\mathrm{effect}$ - The effect size

Methods Paper—maximum word count: 6500
Methods Papers present an advance likely to make major impact in one or more applied
fields. While theory (e.g. theorems concerning statistical or
learning-theoretic properties) are welcome, this is not essential, but intuition and
understanding of why the method works is important.
We are also very open to theory in a broader sense including examples and conjectures.
Generally, we would expect empirical results to demonstrate effectiveness.
However, in cases where the extent of methodological/conceptual innovation is large
enough, results themselves may be illustrative and need not be of immediate high impact
in any particular applied domain.

Each piece should include:

Unstructured Abstract—maximum word count: 250
